# c-project
This was a project made for a course called Computer Architecture and Operating Systems.
The project's goal was to create a program that takes in an input string of random numbers and charactes and clean up everthing that isn't and alphabet. After that the program searches through the string and prints the alphabets that are missing from the input string.
